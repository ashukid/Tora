hi
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine. 
How can I help you today?
I want to have some good food in Jaipur.
Tell me about the type of food you want to have.
I want to have spicy food.
Spice Court in Civil Lines is a good place for spicy Rajasthani food.
I want a large variety of cuisines.
Natraj in MI Road is a good place if you want to have Chinese, Continental, South Indian and other cuisines.
Where can I have something for dessert?
I would recommend Laxmi Misthan Bhandar in Johari Bazaar. It’s the perfect option for a meal or snack in between shopping. Do try the ghevar – a crisp and flaky sweet made from milk, flour and ghee. It’s a Rajasthani speciality.
I want to eat some ice-cream or cheesecake.
I think Molly Moo in Subhash Marg would be a good place for amazing dessert.
Can you tell me the if there is any Keventers here?
Yes, its in World Trade Park, Malviya Nagar.
I want to have milkshakes.
Keventers is the place you are looking for.
